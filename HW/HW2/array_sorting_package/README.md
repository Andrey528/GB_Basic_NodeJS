# This package contains JavaScript implementations of various sorting algorithms:
1) Bubble Sort
2) Selection Sort
3) Insertion Sort
4) Merge Sort
5) Quick Sort

## Bubble Sort
 - Function Name: **bubbleSort**
 - Description: Sorts an array by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
 - Time Complexity: **O(n^2)**

## Selection Sort
 - Function Name: **selectionSort**
 - Description: Sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the beginning.
 - Time Complexity: **O(n^2)**

## Insertion Sort
 - Function Name: **insertionSort**
 - Description: Sorts an array by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
 - Time Complexity: **O(n^2)**

## Merge Sort
 - Function Name: **mergeSort**
 - Description: Sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging them together.
 - Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**

## Quick Sort
 - Function Name: **quickSort**
 - Description: Sorts an array by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays around the pivot.
 - Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**
